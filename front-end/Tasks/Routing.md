# Routing

## Task
This task will build on the first task. After rendering the list of users onto the screen.
Instead of routing to github's site when a user clicks on the `Profile` button, 
make it route to `/users/:username`. Render the page with that user's individual card and a 
list of repositories containing these details, `update_at`, `open_issues_count`, and `language`.
*hint:* Use the `repos_url` from the `api.githug.com/users` api.

### Success
You have successfully performed the task when the user clicks on the `Profile` button and routes
to another page with the user's card and list of repositories related to that user.


#### Have fun!
